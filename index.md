# About
Hi! My name is Marco, I'm a 19 year old kiddo who enjoys coding in his free time.
<br>I grew up eating pizza and playing video games in South Italy, and when I was 16 I decided to properly learn a programming language, and (*god knows how*) I didn't give up after a week.
I started with Java because I wanted to mod minecraft (*level 100 chad here*), but hey, it turned out to be quite useful!

After roughly an year I joined the [Pixelmon](https://pixelmonmod.com/) team as a sidemod developer, and I published a few plugins for [Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org/).
Fast forward an year later, when the mod was [shut down](https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/14/15972052/pixelmon-minecraft-mod-shutdown) thanks to Nintendo, but I had already *left* the team a few months back.

When **unofficial** continuations of the mod started to spread, part the original team decided to revive the mod, and [Reforged](https://reforged.gg/) was created.
A few months later I joined the Reforged team, this time as a main mod dev, and I finally accomplished what I wanted to do when I was an even younger kiddo: developing something that would have been enjoyed by thousands of people.
The major additions made by me are the [Pok√©rus](https://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/index.php?title=Pok%C3%A9rus), and the new [PC](https://youtu.be/UODg7nzIRl8).

# Work
I worked for a lot of servers through out the years, mainly to pay for my dirty cravings (looking at you, useless Vive).
<br>These are the ones that agreed to be my show offs:

I tried to list them in order of appearance, but I couldn't remember all of them.
Apart from those, I also worked full-time for [PixelSpark](https://www.thedestinymc.com/), PokeGeared and Semia.

(watch out for dead links, Minecraft servers are quick to die!)
